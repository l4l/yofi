.. is a minimalistic menu for Wayland-based compositors.

## Installation

Make sure you setup a wayland environment, in particularly `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
env var must be set. `wlr_layer_shell` protocol is not necessary but preferred.
There are several installation options:

- Pre-built release binaries are published at the [Release page](https://github.com/l4l/yofi/releases).
Although these are built in Ubuntu environment it should also work for other Linux distributions.
- \[for Archlinux\] there are [yofi-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yofi-bin/) and
[yofi-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yofi-git/) AUR packages for binary and from-source builds.
- Build last release version from crates.io with `cargo install yofi`.
- Or you can manually [build from sources](#building).
